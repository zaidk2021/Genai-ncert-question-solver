There are also other\\nforms of energy like mechanical energy, light\\nenergy, etc. We have talked about mechanical\\nenergy in the previous chapters. You have\\nbeen taught about conservation of energy,\\nwhich states that we can neither create nor\\ndestroy energy. We  can just change it from\\none form to another. When you clap, a sound\\nis produced. Can you produce sound without\\nutilising your energy? Which form of energy\\ndid you use to produce sound?

A particle of\\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This process continues in the\\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forward themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium through\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressure. This region is called a compression\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\\nit creates a region of low pressure called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\\nthe air. These make the sound wave that\\nFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\\nfork dipped in water\\nFrom the above activities what do you\\nconclude? Can you produce sound without\\na vibrating object?\\nIn the above activities we have produced\\nsound by striking the tuning fork. We can\\nalso produce sound by plucking, scratching,\\nrubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.\\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\\nthe objects? We set the objects vibrating and\\nproduce sound. Vibration means a kind of\\nrapid to and fro motion of an object. The\\nsound of the human voice is produced due\\nto vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird\\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\\nis produced. A stretched rubber band when\\nplucked vibrates and produces sound. If you\\nhave never done this, then do it and observe\\nthe vibration of the stretched rubber band.\\nActivity _____________11.3\\n•\\nMake a list of different types of\\nmusical instruments and discuss\\nwith your friends which part of the\\ninstrument vibrates to produce\\nsound.\\n11.2 Propagation of Sound\\nSound is produced by vibrating objects. The\\nmatter or substance through which sound\\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\\nmedium from the point of generation to the\\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\\nFig. 11.4:\\nA vibrating object creating a series of\\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\\nthe medium.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n129\\npropagates \\nthrough \\nthe \\nmedium.\\nCompression is the region of high pressure\\nand rarefaction is the region of low pressure.\\nPressure is related to the number of particles\\nof a medium in a given volume. More density\\nof the particles in the medium gives more\\npressure and vice versa. Thus, propagation\\nof sound can be visualised as propagation of\\ndensity variations or pressure variations in\\nthe medium.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nHow does the sound produced by\\na vibrating object in a medium\\nreach your ear?\\n2.\\nExplain how sound is produced\\nby your school bell.\\n3.\\nWhy are sound waves called\\nmechanical waves?\\n4.\\nSuppose you and your friend are\\non the moon. Will you be able to\\nhear any sound produced by\\nyour friend?\\n11.2.1 SOUND WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL\\nWAVES\\nActivity _____________11.4\\n•\\nTake a slinky.  Ask your friend to hold\\none end. You hold the other end.\\nNow stretch the slinky as shown in\\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\\ntowards your friend.\\n•\\nWhat do you notice? If you move your\\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\\nalternatively, what will you observe?\\n•\\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\\nwill move back and forth parallel to\\nthe direction of the propagation of the\\ndisturbance.\\nThe regions where the coils become closer\\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave. You will come to know more about\\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\\nWAVE\\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\\n•\\nfrequency\\n•\\namplitude and\\n•\\nspeed.\\nQ\\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\\npressure change when the sound wave moves\\nin the medium. The density as well as the\\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\\nwith distance, above and below the average\\nvalue of density and pressure.

He\\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell’s\\nelectromagnetic theory by\\nhis experiments. He laid the\\nfoundation for future\\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\\nand even television. He also discovered the\\nphotoelectric effect which was later\\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour.\\nFig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\\nwave propagates in the medium.\\nCompressions are the regions where\\nparticles are crowded together and\\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\\nof \\nmaximum \\ncompression. \\nThus,\\ncompressions are regions where density as\\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\\nregions of low pressure where particles are\\nspread apart and are represented by the\\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\\nThe distance between two consecutive\\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\\nusually represented by λ (Greek letter\\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\\nH. R. Hertz\\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b), (c) represents\\ngraphically the density and pressure variations.\\nFrequency tells us how frequently an\\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\\nyour beating the drum. We know that when\\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n131\\nHow the brain interprets the frequency\\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\\nsounds of different pitch.\\nThe magnitude of the maximum\\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\\nas shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\\nwill be that of density or pressure.\\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\\nthe force with which an object is made to\\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\\nchange in density from the maximum value\\nto the minimum value, then again to the\\nmaximum value, makes one complete\\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\\nwave. If we can count the number of the\\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\\nν (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz\\n(symbol, Hz).\\nThe time taken by two consecutive\\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\\nother words, we can say that the time taken\\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\\nFrequency and time period are related as\\nfollows:\\n A violin and a flute may both be played at\\nthe same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\\nof the source.

We sometimes use the terms\\n“loudness” and “intensity” interchangeably,\\nbut they are not the same.

If we hit the table\\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\\nsource.

Like light, sound\\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\\nActivity _____________11.5\\n•\\nTake two identical pipes, as shown in\\nFig. 11.9.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\\nmedia are listed in Table 11.1. You need not\\nmemorise the values.\\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\\nState\\nSubstance\\nSpeed in m/s\\nSolids\\nAluminium\\n6420\\nNickel\\n6040\\nSteel\\n5960\\nIron\\n5950\\nBrass\\n4700\\nGlass (Flint)\\n3980\\nLiquids\\nWater (Sea)\\n1531\\nWater (distilled)\\n1498\\nEthanol\\n1207\\nMethanol\\n1103\\nGases\\nHydrogen\\n1284\\nHelium\\n965\\nAir\\n346\\nOxygen\\n316\\nSulphur dioxide\\n213\\nFig. 11.9: Reflection of sound\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n134\\n11.3.1 ECHO\\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\\nobject such as a tall building or a\\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\\nagain a little  later. This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\\ncliff and the person\\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\\nQ\\nHorn\\nMegaphone\\nFig 11.10:  A megaphone and a horn.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nAn echo is heard in 3 s.

Children under the age of\\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\\nthe animals.

A particle of\\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This process continues in the\\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forward themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium through\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressure. This region is called a compression\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\\nit creates a region of low pressure called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4.

Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave. You will come to know more about\\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\\nWAVE\\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\\n•\\nfrequency\\n•\\namplitude and\\n•\\nspeed.\\nQ\\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\\npressure change when the sound wave moves\\nin the medium. The density as well as the\\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\\nwith distance, above and below the average\\nvalue of density and pressure.

He\\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell’s\\nelectromagnetic theory by\\nhis experiments. He laid the\\nfoundation for future\\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\\nand even television. He also discovered the\\nphotoelectric effect which was later\\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour.\\nFig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\\nwave propagates in the medium.\\nCompressions are the regions where\\nparticles are crowded together and\\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\\nof \\nmaximum \\ncompression. \\nThus,\\ncompressions are regions where density as\\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\\nregions of low pressure where particles are\\nspread apart and are represented by the\\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\\nThe distance between two consecutive\\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\\nusually represented by λ (Greek letter\\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\\nH. R. Hertz\\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b), (c) represents\\ngraphically the density and pressure variations.\\nFrequency tells us how frequently an\\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\\nyour beating the drum. We know that when\\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n131\\nHow the brain interprets the frequency\\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\\nsounds of different pitch.\\nThe magnitude of the maximum\\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\\nas shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\\nwill be that of density or pressure.\\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\\nthe force with which an object is made to\\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\\nchange in density from the maximum value\\nto the minimum value, then again to the\\nmaximum value, makes one complete\\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\\nwave. If we can count the number of the\\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\\nν (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz\\n(symbol, Hz).\\nThe time taken by two consecutive\\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\\nother words, we can say that the time taken\\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\\nFrequency and time period are related as\\nfollows:\\n A violin and a flute may both be played at\\nthe same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\\nof the source.

Like light, sound\\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\\nActivity _____________11.5\\n•\\nTake two identical pipes, as shown in\\nFig. 11.9.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\\nmedia are listed in Table 11.1. You need not\\nmemorise the values.\\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\\nState\\nSubstance\\nSpeed in m/s\\nSolids\\nAluminium\\n6420\\nNickel\\n6040\\nSteel\\n5960\\nIron\\n5950\\nBrass\\n4700\\nGlass (Flint)\\n3980\\nLiquids\\nWater (Sea)\\n1531\\nWater (distilled)\\n1498\\nEthanol\\n1207\\nMethanol\\n1103\\nGases\\nHydrogen\\n1284\\nHelium\\n965\\nAir\\n346\\nOxygen\\n316\\nSulphur dioxide\\n213\\nFig. 11.9: Reflection of sound\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n134\\n11.3.1 ECHO\\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\\nobject such as a tall building or a\\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\\nagain a little  later. This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\\ncliff and the person\\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\\nQ\\nHorn\\nMegaphone\\nFig 11.10:  A megaphone and a horn.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nAn echo is heard in 3 s.

Children under the age of\\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\\nthe animals.

A particle of\\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This process continues in the\\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forward themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium through\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressure. This region is called a compression\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\\nit creates a region of low pressure called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\\nthe air. These make the sound wave that\\nFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\\nfork dipped in water\\nFrom the above activities what do you\\nconclude? Can you produce sound without\\na vibrating object?\\nIn the above activities we have produced\\nsound by striking the tuning fork. We can\\nalso produce sound by plucking, scratching,\\nrubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.\\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\\nthe objects? We set the objects vibrating and\\nproduce sound. Vibration means a kind of\\nrapid to and fro motion of an object. The\\nsound of the human voice is produced due\\nto vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird\\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\\nis produced. A stretched rubber band when\\nplucked vibrates and produces sound. If you\\nhave never done this, then do it and observe\\nthe vibration of the stretched rubber band.\\nActivity _____________11.3\\n•\\nMake a list of different types of\\nmusical instruments and discuss\\nwith your friends which part of the\\ninstrument vibrates to produce\\nsound.\\n11.2 Propagation of Sound\\nSound is produced by vibrating objects. The\\nmatter or substance through which sound\\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\\nmedium from the point of generation to the\\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\\nFig. 11.4:\\nA vibrating object creating a series of\\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\\nthe medium.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n129\\npropagates \\nthrough \\nthe \\nmedium.\\nCompression is the region of high pressure\\nand rarefaction is the region of low pressure.\\nPressure is related to the number of particles\\nof a medium in a given volume. More density\\nof the particles in the medium gives more\\npressure and vice versa. Thus, propagation\\nof sound can be visualised as propagation of\\ndensity variations or pressure variations in\\nthe medium.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nHow does the sound produced by\\na vibrating object in a medium\\nreach your ear?\\n2.\\nExplain how sound is produced\\nby your school bell.\\n3.\\nWhy are sound waves called\\nmechanical waves?\\n4.\\nSuppose you and your friend are\\non the moon. Will you be able to\\nhear any sound produced by\\nyour friend?\\n11.2.1 SOUND WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL\\nWAVES\\nActivity _____________11.4\\n•\\nTake a slinky.  Ask your friend to hold\\none end. You hold the other end.\\nNow stretch the slinky as shown in\\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\\ntowards your friend.\\n•\\nWhat do you notice? If you move your\\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\\nalternatively, what will you observe?\\n•\\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\\nwill move back and forth parallel to\\nthe direction of the propagation of the\\ndisturbance.\\nThe regions where the coils become closer\\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave. You will come to know more about\\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\\nWAVE\\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\\n•\\nfrequency\\n•\\namplitude and\\n•\\nspeed.\\nQ\\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\\npressure change when the sound wave moves\\nin the medium. The density as well as the\\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\\nwith distance, above and below the average\\nvalue of density and pressure. Fig. 11.6(a) and\\n(b)\\n(a)\\nFig. 11.5: Longitudinal wave in a slinky.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n130\\nHeinrich Rudolph Hertz\\nwas born on 22 February\\n1857 \\nin \\nHamburg,\\nGermany and educated at\\nthe University of Berlin. He\\nconfirmed J.C. Maxwell’s\\nelectromagnetic theory by\\nhis experiments. He laid the\\nfoundation for future\\ndevelopment of radio, telephone, telegraph\\nand even television. He also discovered the\\nphotoelectric effect which was later\\nexplained by Albert Einstein. The SI unit of\\nfrequency was named as hertz in his honour.\\nFig. 11.6(b) represent the density and\\npressure variations, respectively, as a sound\\nwave propagates in the medium.\\nCompressions are the regions where\\nparticles are crowded together and\\nrepresented by the upper portion of the curve\\nin Fig. 11.6(c). The peak represents the region\\nof \\nmaximum \\ncompression. \\nThus,\\ncompressions are regions where density as\\nwell as pressure is high. Rarefactions are the\\nregions of low pressure where particles are\\nspread apart and are represented by the\\nvalley, that is, the lower portion of the curve\\nin Fig. 11.6(c). A peak is called the crest and a\\nvalley is called the trough of a wave.\\nThe distance between two consecutive\\ncompressions (C) or two consecutive\\nrarefactions (R) is called the wavelength, as\\nshown in Fig. 11.6(c), The wavelength is\\nusually represented by λ (Greek letter\\nlambda). Its SI unit is metre (m).\\nH. R. Hertz\\nFig. 11.6: Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in (a) and (b), (c) represents\\ngraphically the density and pressure variations.\\nFrequency tells us how frequently an\\nevent occurs. Suppose you are beating a\\ndrum. How many times you are beating the\\ndrum in unit time is called the frequency of\\nyour beating the drum. We know that when\\nsound is propagated through a medium, the\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n131\\nHow the brain interprets the frequency\\nof an emitted sound is called its pitch. The\\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\\nsounds of different pitch.\\nThe magnitude of the maximum\\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,\\nas shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\\nwill be that of density or pressure.\\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\\nthe force with which an object is made to\\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\\nchange in density from the maximum value\\nto the minimum value, then again to the\\nmaximum value, makes one complete\\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\\nwave. If we can count the number of the\\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\\nν (Greek letter, nu). Its SI unit is hertz\\n(symbol, Hz).\\nThe time taken by two consecutive\\ncompressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed\\npoint is called the time period of the wave. In\\nother words, we can say that the time taken\\nfor one complete oscillation is called the time\\nperiod of the sound wave. It is represented by\\nthe symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).\\nFrequency and time period are related as\\nfollows:\\n A violin and a flute may both be played at\\nthe same time in an orchestra. Both sounds\\ntravel through the same medium, that is, air\\nand arrive at our ear at the same time. Both\\nsounds travel at the same speed irrespective\\nof the source.

What is the time interval\\nbetween successive compressions\\nfrom the source?\\nThe amount of sound energy passing each\\nsecond through unit area is called the intensity\\nof sound. We sometimes use the terms\\n“loudness” and “intensity” interchangeably,\\nbut they are not the same. Loudness is a\\nmeasure of the response of the ear to the sound.\\nEven when two sounds are of equal intensity,\\nwe may hear one as louder than the other\\nsimply because our ear detects it better.\\nof less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table\\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\\nsource. As it moves away from the source its\\namplitude as well as its loudness decreases.\\nLouder sound can travel a larger distance as\\nit is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8\\nshows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft\\nsound of the same frequency.\\nThe quality or timber of sound is that\\ncharacteristic which enables us to distinguish\\none sound from another having the same pitch\\nand loudness. The sound which is more\\npleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound\\nof single frequency is called a tone.

Like light, sound\\ngets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid\\nand follows the same laws of reflection as you\\nhave studied in earlier classes. The directions\\nin which the sound is incident and is reflected\\nmake equal angles with the normal to the\\nreflecting surface at the point of incidence, and\\nthe three are in the same plane. An obstacle of\\nlarge size which may be polished or rough is\\nneeded for the reflection of sound waves.\\nActivity _____________11.5\\n•\\nTake two identical pipes, as shown in\\nFig. 11.9.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\\nmedia are listed in Table 11.1. You need not\\nmemorise the values.\\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\\nState\\nSubstance\\nSpeed in m/s\\nSolids\\nAluminium\\n6420\\nNickel\\n6040\\nSteel\\n5960\\nIron\\n5950\\nBrass\\n4700\\nGlass (Flint)\\n3980\\nLiquids\\nWater (Sea)\\n1531\\nWater (distilled)\\n1498\\nEthanol\\n1207\\nMethanol\\n1103\\nGases\\nHydrogen\\n1284\\nHelium\\n965\\nAir\\n346\\nOxygen\\n316\\nSulphur dioxide\\n213\\nFig. 11.9: Reflection of sound\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n134\\n11.3.1 ECHO\\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\\nobject such as a tall building or a\\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\\nagain a little  later. This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\\ncliff and the person\\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\\nQ\\nHorn\\nMegaphone\\nFig 11.10:  A megaphone and a horn.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nAn echo is heard in 3 s.

In stethoscopes the sound of the\\npatient’s heartbeat reaches the doctor’s\\nears by multiple reflection of sound, as\\nshown in Fig.11.11.\\nFig. 11.12: Curved ceiling of a conference hall.\\nFig. 11.13: Sound board used in a big hall.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nWhy are the ceilings of concert\\nhalls curved?\\n11.4 Range of Hearing\\nThe audible range of sound for human beings\\nextends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one\\nHz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of\\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\\nthe animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz\\nare called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.\\nUltrasound is produced by animals such as\\ndolphins, bats and porpoises.

A particle of\\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This process continues in the\\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forward themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium through\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressure. This region is called a compression\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\\nit creates a region of low pressure called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\\nthe air. These make the sound wave that\\nFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\\nfork dipped in water\\nFrom the above activities what do you\\nconclude? Can you produce sound without\\na vibrating object?\\nIn the above activities we have produced\\nsound by striking the tuning fork. We can\\nalso produce sound by plucking, scratching,\\nrubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.\\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\\nthe objects? We set the objects vibrating and\\nproduce sound. Vibration means a kind of\\nrapid to and fro motion of an object. The\\nsound of the human voice is produced due\\nto vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird\\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\\nis produced. A stretched rubber band when\\nplucked vibrates and produces sound.

The\\nmatter or substance through which sound\\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\\nmedium from the point of generation to the\\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\\nFig. 11.4:\\nA vibrating object creating a series of\\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\\nthe medium.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n129\\npropagates \\nthrough \\nthe \\nmedium.\\nCompression is the region of high pressure\\nand rarefaction is the region of low pressure.\\nPressure is related to the number of particles\\nof a medium in a given volume.

If you move your\\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\\nalternatively, what will you observe?\\n•\\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\\nwill move back and forth parallel to\\nthe direction of the propagation of the\\ndisturbance.\\nThe regions where the coils become closer\\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave. You will come to know more about\\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\\nWAVE\\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\\n•\\nfrequency\\n•\\namplitude and\\n•\\nspeed.\\nQ\\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\\npressure change when the sound wave moves\\nin the medium.

The\\nchange in density from the maximum value\\nto the minimum value, then again to the\\nmaximum value, makes one complete\\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\\nwave. If we can count the number of the\\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\\nν (Greek letter, nu).

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium through which it travels. You will\\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\\nmedia are listed in Table 11.1. You need not\\nmemorise the values.\\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\\nState\\nSubstance\\nSpeed in m/s\\nSolids\\nAluminium\\n6420\\nNickel\\n6040\\nSteel\\n5960\\nIron\\n5950\\nBrass\\n4700\\nGlass (Flint)\\n3980\\nLiquids\\nWater (Sea)\\n1531\\nWater (distilled)\\n1498\\nEthanol\\n1207\\nMethanol\\n1103\\nGases\\nHydrogen\\n1284\\nHelium\\n965\\nAir\\n346\\nOxygen\\n316\\nSulphur dioxide\\n213\\nFig. 11.9: Reflection of sound\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n134\\n11.3.1 ECHO\\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\\nobject such as a tall building or a\\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\\nagain a little  later. This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson.

Children under the age of\\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\\nthe animals.

A particle of\\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\\nobject is first displaced from its equilibrium\\nposition. It then exerts a force on the adjacent\\nparticle. As a result of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced from its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This process continues in the\\nmedium till the sound reaches your ear. The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in turn produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forward themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forward. This is what\\nhappens during propagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and are\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium through\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressure. This region is called a compression\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwards,\\nit creates a region of low pressure called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\\nthe air. These make the sound wave that\\nFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\\nfork dipped in water\\nFrom the above activities what do you\\nconclude? Can you produce sound without\\na vibrating object?\\nIn the above activities we have produced\\nsound by striking the tuning fork. We can\\nalso produce sound by plucking, scratching,\\nrubbing, blowing or shaking different objects.\\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\\nthe objects? We set the objects vibrating and\\nproduce sound. Vibration means a kind of\\nrapid to and fro motion of an object. The\\nsound of the human voice is produced due\\nto vibrations in the vocal cords. When a bird\\nflaps its wings, do you hear any sound? Think\\nhow the buzzing sound accompanying a bee\\nis produced. A stretched rubber band when\\nplucked vibrates and produces sound.

The\\nmatter or substance through which sound\\nis transmitted is called a medium. It can be\\nsolid, liquid or gas. Sound moves through a\\nmedium from the point of generation to the\\nlistener. When an object vibrates, it sets the\\nparticles of the medium around it vibrating.\\nThe particles do not travel all the way from\\nFig. 11.4:\\nA vibrating object creating a series of\\ncompressions (C) and rarefactions (R) in\\nthe medium.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSOUND\\n129\\npropagates \\nthrough \\nthe \\nmedium.\\nCompression is the region of high pressure\\nand rarefaction is the region of low pressure.\\nPressure is related to the number of particles\\nof a medium in a given volume.

If you move your\\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\\nalternatively, what will you observe?\\n•\\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\\nwill move back and forth parallel to\\nthe direction of the propagation of the\\ndisturbance.\\nThe regions where the coils become closer\\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave. You will come to know more about\\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\\nWAVE\\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\\n•\\nfrequency\\n•\\namplitude and\\n•\\nspeed.\\nQ\\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\\npressure change when the sound wave moves\\nin the medium.

If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wave\\ndensity of the medium oscillates between a\\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\\nchange in density from the maximum value\\nto the minimum value, then again to the\\nmaximum value, makes one complete\\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\\nwave. If we can count the number of the\\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\\nν (Greek letter, nu).

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium through which it travels.

In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC. The speeds\\nof sound at a particular temperature in various\\nmedia are listed in Table 11.1. You need not\\nmemorise the values.\\nTable 11.1: Speed of sound in\\ndifferent media at 25 ºC\\nState\\nSubstance\\nSpeed in m/s\\nSolids\\nAluminium\\n6420\\nNickel\\n6040\\nSteel\\n5960\\nIron\\n5950\\nBrass\\n4700\\nGlass (Flint)\\n3980\\nLiquids\\nWater (Sea)\\n1531\\nWater (distilled)\\n1498\\nEthanol\\n1207\\nMethanol\\n1103\\nGases\\nHydrogen\\n1284\\nHelium\\n965\\nAir\\n346\\nOxygen\\n316\\nSulphur dioxide\\n213\\nFig. 11.9: Reflection of sound\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n134\\n11.3.1 ECHO\\nIf we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting\\nobject such as a tall building or a\\nmountain,we will hear the same sound\\nagain a little  later. This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\\ncliff and the person\\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\\nQ\\nHorn\\nMegaphone\\nFig 11.10:  A megaphone and a horn.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nAn echo is heard in 3 s.

In stethoscopes the sound of the\\npatient’s heartbeat reaches the doctor’s\\nears by multiple reflection of sound, as\\nshown in Fig.11.11.\\nFig. 11.12: Curved ceiling of a conference hall.\\nFig. 11.13: Sound board used in a big hall.\\nuestion\\n1.\\nWhy are the ceilings of concert\\nhalls curved?\\n11.4 Range of Hearing\\nThe audible range of sound for human beings\\nextends from about 20 Hz to 20000 Hz (one\\nHz = one cycle/s). Children under the age of\\nfive and some animals, such as dogs can hear\\nup to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people\\ngrow older their ears become less sensitive to\\nhigher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies\\nbelow 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or\\ninfrasound. If we could hear infrasound we\\nwould hear the vibrations of a pendulum just\\nas we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.\\nRhinoceroses communicate using infrasound\\nof frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and\\nelephants produce sound in the infrasound\\nrange. It is observed that some animals get\\ndisturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes\\nproduce low-frequency infrasound before the\\nmain shock waves begin which possibly alert\\nthe animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz\\nare called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.\\nUltrasound is produced by animals such as\\ndolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain\\nfamilies have very sensitive hearing equipment.\\nThese moths can hear the high frequency\\nQ\\nFig.11.11: Stethoscope\\n3.\\nGenerally the ceilings of concert halls,\\nconference halls and cinema halls are\\ncurved so that sound after reflection\\nreaches all corners of the hall, as\\nshown in Fig 11.12. Sometimes a\\ncurved soundboard may be placed\\nbehind the stage so that the sound,\\nafter reflecting from the sound board,\\nspreads evenly across the width of the\\nhall (Fig 11.13).\\nIn these instruments, a tube followed\\nby a conical opening reflects sound\\nsuccessively to guide most of the\\nsound waves from the source in the\\nforward direction towards the\\naudience.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\nSCIENCE\\n136\\nsqueaks of the bat and know when a bat\\nis flying nearby, and are able to escape\\ncapture.

            "\n",
            "1. **Vibrating Object:**  Anything that vibrates (moves back and forth rapidly) can produce sound. This could be a tuning fork, a drum, your vocal cords, or even the wind blowing across a tree. \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Disturbance in the Medium:** The vibrating object disturbs the particles of the medium (like air, water, or a solid) around it. It pushes and pulls on these particles, causing them to vibrate as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Compressions and Rarefactions:** These vibrations create areas of high pressure called **compressions** (where particles are closer together) and areas of low pressure called **rarefactions** (where particles are spread out). \n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Wave Propagation:** The compressions and rarefactions travel outward from the vibrating object in a wave-like pattern. This is how sound travels through the medium.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Reaching the Ear:** When these compressions and rarefactions reach your ear, they cause the eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations are transmitted to the inner ear, where they are converted into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, which interprets them as sound.\n",
